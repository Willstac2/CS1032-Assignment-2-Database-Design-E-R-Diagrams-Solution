这个作业是一个大楼的蓝图 我们需要有蓝图才能够建好一个database

This project requires you to create a database design. Your design will be documented in a set of Entity-Relationship diagrams using the representation as shown in the lecture materials. Draw a set of Entity-Relationship diagrams to model the following scenario.

For the product, your design must be able to store:

the product’s name (i.e. Smiley Pin, Comic Book Bow Tie, Niblick Soft, etc.)

the product ‘s classification (i.e. shirt, novelty, edible, pillow, pant, shoes, etc.)

the product’s retail cost to the consumer (price in dollars).

the product’s size (Small, Medium or Large)

the product’s shipping weight classification (Light, Medium or Heavy)

For the invoice (when a customer orders a product), your design must be able to store:

the invoice date

the invoice total amount

the invoice status (New, Shipped or Paid)

For the employee your design must be able to store:

the employee’s last name

the employee’s first name

All attributes are to be considered as mandatory unless specifically stated differently above.

上面的每个都是一个entity

HINT: a field is missing in each of the above. Hopefully, it will be very obvious ….

接下来你需要传达以下的关系了

Next, you need to store the following relationships:

When a customer orders a product, an invoice will be CREATED. Each invoice will consist of a single customer associated to a single invoice. Each invoice can only be created by a single customer.

A customer must have at least one invoice associated (otherwise why would they be in the system?). A customer can have more than one invoice if they have order a number of times from your company. An invoice must have a customer associated (otherwise, why was it created?). An invoice can only be associated with a single customer.

At the end of the document, include your name, Student number and Western ID (the first part of your

Western email (i.e. if your email is – ibrai2328@uwo.ca your ID will be – ibrai2328)

Formatting is not important as long as the document is easy to follow:

This document must be a Word file saved and submitted as a .doc (or .docx) file

The name must be a combination of your Western Account Name and the name of your company. The file name must be youraccountname_companyname_A2.doc (or .docx)

Do NOT submit this backup file. It can NOT be opened by the TAs.

It is YOUR responsibility to ensure the correct files are submitted.

It is your responsibility to ensure the files have been submitted in OWL.

Please check and make sure you have received the confirming email and then check that the two (2) files (you must submit two (2) files for this assignment) have been uploaded correctly.
